## 💡 Key Business Insights

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** exhibit the highest churn rates, highlighting the need for loyalty programs or longer-term engagement strategies.
- Users who pay via **electronic checks** are more likely to churn, suggesting potential friction in the payment experience.
- **Long-tenure customers** tend to remain loyal, making them ideal candidates for upselling and premium service offerings.
- Elevated **monthly charges**, especially among **short-tenure users**, are strongly associated with churn—indicating a mismatch between perceived value and cost.
- Surprisingly, **unlimited data plan users consuming less than 10 GB** show higher churn likelihood, possibly due to underutilization or misaligned plan benefits.
- A significant portion of churn is driven by **competitor influence**, underscoring the importance of competitive benchmarking and customer satisfaction initiatives.
